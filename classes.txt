//C++ says that you can use same class for differrent data types.
It works for any type of data. 

We can have different types of data types in C++ using template clASS.
WE USE CLASSES CAZ IT ALLOCATES MEMORY STRAIGHT TO HEAP WHEREAS STRUCT DOES IN STACK BY DEFAULT.
 A CLASS ENSURES SECURITY. MEMBERS OF A CLASS ARE PVT BY DEFULT WHEREAD PUBLIC IN STRUCTURE BY DEFAULT.
WE WANT PVT MEMBERS CAZ WE DO NOT WANT ANY NOOB TO CHANGE OUR DATA.
CLASS
/ Program 1 
#include <stdio.h> 
  
class Test { 
    int x; // x is private 
}; 
int main() 
{ 
  Test t; 
  t.x = 20; // compiler error because x is private 
  getchar(); 
  return 0; 
} 

STRUCTURE   
// Program 2 
#include <stdio.h> 
struct Test { 
    int x; // x is public 
}; 
int main() 
{ 
  Test t; 
  t.x = 20; // works fine because x is public 
  getchar(); 
  return 0;}
